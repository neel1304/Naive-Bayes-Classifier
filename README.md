# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier.
Getting started with Data Science & tried implementing a prima-data science classification algorithm for classifying input datas into categories.

Dataset is not imported, it's created during run time, will be properly implemented with proper data sets into an app & web-app.
